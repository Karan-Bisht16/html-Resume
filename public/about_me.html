<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Alright let's do this one last time. 
  My name is Karan Bisht, I am an (aspiring) Web Developer and 
  for the past 2 days I have been the one and only Web Developer *in my house*.
  <br> insert <dfn>"what a day"</dfn><br>
  <br>I'm sure you know the rest... Right?!
  You see, I made some projects and some more, maybe too many. Made some dicy choices. Don't just buy any cheap course online. Then some time passed blah... blah... blah...
  I broke my back. Got my vision screwed. I buired my sanity. Me and my love for web dev. got split up.
  But I handled it like a champ!
  <br> insert <dfn>soft sobbing</dfn>
  <br><h4>Cause you know what no matter how many times I get hit I ALWAYS get back up.</h4>
  And I got a lot of time to reflect and work on myself. Did you know that seahorses, that they mate for life?
  Could you imagine? A seahorse seeing another seehorse and then making it work?
  <br><dfn>flash forward</dfn>
  <br>
  I'm in my aparment coding my new project, getting better...
