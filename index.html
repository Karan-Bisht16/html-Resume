    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to my space! I'm Karan Bisht, an aspiring FrontEnd Developer dedicated to creating seemless web experience. 
        With a keen eye for design and a strong technical skill set, I love to craft memorable and user-centric interfaces.
        <br>
        Throughout my academic journey at ADGITM, I have consistently demonstrated excellence, securing the 1st rank in the 3rd semester in the IT Department. 
        <br>
        Drawing on my expertise in technologies such as HTML5, I bring your ideas to life by blending creativity with functionality. 
        <!-- Whether it's implementing responsive layouts, optimizing performance, or ensuring a good user experience. -->
        <br>
        With a strong foundation in programming languages including C, C++, and Java, I'm able to handle complex coding challenges. 
        <!-- I'm also experienced in utilizing libraries and frameworks like Material UI, Bootstrap, and React to enhance the visual appeal and interactivity of web applications.-->
    </p>
    <p>
        Apart from the things I'm good at, in my free time, I enjoy doing various activities like traditional and digital drawing to enjoy my creative side and express myself.
